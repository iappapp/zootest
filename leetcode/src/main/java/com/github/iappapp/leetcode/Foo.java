/**
 * Suppose we have a class:
 * public class Foo {
 *   public void first() { print("first"); }
 *   public void second() { print("second"); }
 *   public void third() { print("third"); }
 * }
 *
 * The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads.
 * Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third().
 * Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,2,3]
 * Output: "firstsecondthird"
 * Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously.
 * The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third().
 * "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [1,3,2]
 * Output: "firstsecondthird"
 * Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second().
 * "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
